## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I have a clear plan to execute once i start, i feel comfortable with react. I also feel confident because i will get help if needed.
### Weaknesses:
Grid and styling are my weaknesses, im afraid to spend longer than anticipated on those two.
### Opportunities:
It will give me hands on experience with everything, apart from homework and labs. I will be able to gain experience creating an app in a short amount of time.
### Threats:
Not asking for help, i got a bad habit to not ask for help until the very last minute, but i need to change that.
